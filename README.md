# hangman

This project will allow me to: 
- practice object oriented design.
- implement game saves through serialization.
- try the colorize dependancy for the first time.

The biggest challenge of this project was implementing the save feature.

Bugs:
- saved games not loading properly
- if playing loaded game, end_game prompts twice
- may need to convert colorize dependancy to code for repl?
